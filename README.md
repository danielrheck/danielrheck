### Hey there, I'm Daniel, a Full Stack Developer based in Berlin. I like coding, music, photography and cooking.

#### I'm currently working on some side projects, including:

<br>

#### [_Wordle copycat_](https://github.com/danielrheck/wordle-next-js):

This project was made using **Next.js**, with only functional components. It required a fair amount of state management, and I decided to use **Recoil.js** as a global state manager combined with **React Hooks** for local state. Regarding the back-end, I used **Express** for my APIs calls and **MongoDB** for the simple database this project required.

<br>

#### [_Social Media_](https://github.com/danielrheck/social-network):

For the social media project, I used **React**. The state management on this one is done with **Redux**. The pictures that users upload goes to **AWS S3**. The database for this project is **PostgresSQL** and the back-end Express. Also, it uses **Socket.io** for the live chat.
